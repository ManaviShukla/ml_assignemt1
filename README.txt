Project: Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Algorithms
This README provides instructions on how to retrieve the code, data, and dependencies, and how to run the code for the project "Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Algorithms".


1. Retrieving the Code
GitHub Repository:
Clone the repository using the following command:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ManaviShukla/ml_assignemt1.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the repository from the GitHub page and extract it to your desired directory.
2. Retrieving the Data

Data Sources:

Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset: It is being extracted in the code itself using ucimlrepo module
Customer Churn Dataset: Kaggle Churn Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset?select=customer_churn_dataset-testing-master.csv

Downloading the Data:
Download the datasets from the provided links.
Place the Churn datasets in the "churn" directory within the project folder.

3. Installing Dependencies
Using requirements.txt:

Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd your-repository
Install the required libraries using pip:
sh

scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter

4. Running the Code
Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook:
sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the run_model.ipynb file from the Jupyter interface.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

5. Additionally, there is an analysis notebook, to test out various variations of the analysis and intermediate results in the assignment
